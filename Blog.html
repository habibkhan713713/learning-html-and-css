<p id="ab"> <img src="yogurt 10.png" alt="" style="padding-left: 400px;" ><br> Yogurt (UK: /ˈjɒɡərt/; US: /ˈjoʊɡərt/, from Turkish: yoğurt, Armenian: յոգուրտ) also spelled yoghurt, yogourt or yoghourt, is a food produced by bacterial fermentation of milk. <br> The bacteria used to make yogurt are known as yogurt cultures. <br> Fermentation of sugars in the milk by these bacteria produces lactic acid, which acts on milk protein to give yogurt its texture and characteristic tart flavor. Cow's milk is commonly available worldwide and, as such, is the milk most commonly used to make yogurt. <br>  Milk from water buffalo, goats, ewes, mares, camels, yaks and plant milks are also used to produce yogurt. <br> The milk used may be homogenized or not. <br> It may be pasteurized or raw. <br> Each type of milk produces substantially different results. <br>

   <img class="abcd" src="yogurt 6.jpg" alt="" style="padding-left: 400px;"  > <br> Yogurt is produced using a culture of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. <br> bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus bacteria. <br> <img class="abcd" src="yogurt 3.jpg" alt="" style="padding-left: 400px;"> <br> In addition, other lactobacilli and bifidobacteria are sometimes added during or after culturing yogurt. Some countries require yogurt to contain a specific amount of colony-forming units (CFU) of bacteria; in China, for example, the requirement for the number of lactobacillus bacteria is at least 1 million CFU per milliliter.
